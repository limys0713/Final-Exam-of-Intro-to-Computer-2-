Description
----------------------------

Lab 4


A)The encoded identifiers are used for the functions are:
0000000100401080 T _Z7averagePdRd
00000001004010b8 T _Z7averageif
00000001004010e4 T main

B)The output of the following program is:
1 8
4 8
4 8
8 8
It is because the size of char is 1 byte, size of integer and float is 4 bytes, size of double is 8 bytes. The reason why the size of pointer is 
8 bytes here is that my computer is a 64bit system, thus the pointer is 8 bytes(if the computer is 32bit system, it will result in 4 bytes in 
the size of pointer.)
